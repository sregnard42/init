ipconfig getifaddr en0 | xargs dig +short -x

# from `man dig`
#-x addr
#           Simplified reverse lookups, for mapping addresses to names. The addr is an IPv4
#           address in dotted-decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When the
#           -x is used, there is no need to provide the name, class and type arguments.
#           dig automatically performs a lookup for a name like 94.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa and
#           sets the query type and class to PTR and IN respectively. IPv6 addresses are
#           looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain (but see also the -i
#           option).
#
# Basically we use dig -x when we want to Reverse DNS, +short output only the name
