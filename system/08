~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# `man ssh`
#  The file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys lists the public keys that are permitted for logging in.
#  When the user logs in, the ssh program tells the server which key pair it would like to use
#  for authentication.  The client proves that it has access to the private key and the server
#  checks that the corresponding public key is authorized to accept the account.
