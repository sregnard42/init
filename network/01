ifconfig -l

# from `man ifconfig`
#
# The -l flag may be used to list all available interfaces on the system,
# with no other additional information.
# Use of this flag is mutually exclusive with all other flags and commands,
# except for -d (only list interfaces that are down)
# and -u (only list interfaces that are up).
